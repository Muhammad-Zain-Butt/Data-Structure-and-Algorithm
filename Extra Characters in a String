//2707. Extra Characters in a String
/* You are given a 0-indexed string s and a dictionary of words dictionary. 
You have to break s into one or more non-overlapping substrings such that each substring is present in dictionary. 
There may be some extra characters in s which are not present in any of the substrings.
Return the minimum number of extra characters left over if you break up s optimally.
Example 1:
Input: s = "leetscode", dictionary = ["leet","code","leetcode"]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "leet" from index 0 to 3 and "code" from index 5 to 8. 
There is only 1 unused character (at index 4), so we return 1.
Example 2:
Input: s = "sayhelloworld", dictionary = ["hello","world"]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can break s in two substrings: "hello" from index 3 to 7 and "world" from index 8 to 12. 
The characters at indices 0, 1, 2 are not used in any substring and thus are considered as extra characters. Hence, we return 3.
Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary.length <= 50
1 <= dictionary[i].length <= 50
dictionary[i] and s consists of only lowercase English letters
dictionary contains distinct words */
